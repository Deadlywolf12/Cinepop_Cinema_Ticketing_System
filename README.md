# Cinepop_Cinema_Ticketing_System

hey there this is my second semester  swing gui project with database connectivity
Its a cinema ticket system application with admin panel from where admin can delete edit or add new movies directly from application
it's not perfect but will try to make it perfect in future 
im also thinking to launch same android application soon
hope you liked it

if you want to try it then just download the jar file and database file , import cinepop.sql file to phpmyadmin then run the jar file and your good to go
note: users balance on registration has been set to 600 by default because you wont has access to pib database which you change from cinepop database but if you want to use bank transaction init then you should import PIB database too and create your account there thanks !
